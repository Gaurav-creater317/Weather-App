##🌤️ Weather App using JavaScript – API Project
Hey DEV Community! 👋

I'm excited to share a project I recently completed — a Weather Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This was my first real experience working with APIs, and I learned a lot about how to fetch and display real-time data dynamically on a webpage.
